  The entire set of his SB16 patches have been integrated into

><P
>Right now, MPU401 emulation is next to perfect. It supports UART
and SBMIDI mode, because the SB16's MPU401 ports can't do anything else as well.</P
><P
>The digital audio basically works, but the emulation is too slow for fluent
output unless the application doesn't do much in the background (or the
foreground, really). The sound tends to looping or crackle on slower
computer, but the emulation appears to be correct. Even a MOD
player works, although only for lower sampling speeds.</P
><P
>Also, the MIDI data running through the MPU401 ports can be written
into a SMF, that is the standard midi file. The wave output
can be written into a VOC file, which has a format defined by
Creative Labs. This file format can be converted to WAV by
sox for example.</P

NAME="AEN1416">Output to a sound card</H2
><P
>Output is supported on Linux and Windows 95 at the moment.
On Linux, the output goes to any file or device. If you have a
wavetable synthesizer, midi can go to /dev/midi00, otherwise you may need
a midi interpreter. For example, the midid program from the
DosEmu project would work. Wave output should go to /dev/dsp.
These devices are assumed to be OSS devices, if they're not
some of the ioctl's might fail.
On Windows, midi and output goes to the midi mapper and the wave mapper,
respectively. A future version might have selectable output devices.</P

>BX_USE_SB16_SMF should be 1 unless you intend to have several sound cards
running at the same time.</P
><P
>BX_USE_SOUND_VIRTUAL can be 0 or 1, and determines whether the output class
uses virtual functions or not. The former is more versatile and allows to
select the class at runtime (not supported at the moment), while the latter
is slightly faster.</P
><P
>BX_SOUND_OUTPUT_C is the name of the class used for output.  The default is
to have no output functions, so you need to change this if you want any sound.

>-i number: shows the selected emulator info string,

-t six numbers: loads a translation into the translation table. The
        numbers are:
        OldBankMSB,OldBankLSB,OldProgram,NewBankMSB,NewBankLSB,NewProgram

        to change patch 0 (Piano) to patch 32 (Acoustic Bass)

-r: Reset the patch translation table
        e.g. sb16ctrl -r

-m some numbers: Upload the given numbers to the midi output device. Note
        that it should be a complete midi message, and also that it is
        subject to patch translation.
        e.g. sb16ctrl -m 0x80,64,0
        to send a note-off message to channel 0.

-f filename: Reads in a file and executes the commands in it. These have
        the same format as the above commands, except that they don't have
        the dash "-" in front of them.
        Comment lines are supported and start with a hash sign "#".

-h: Show a brief summary of the commands.</PRE
