>Bochs can now simulate an SMP machine when you use "--enable-processors=N" 
in the configure command.  SMP support was added by Bryce Denney, who
was very interested in watching a multiprocessor operating system work 
at a low level.  It should also be helpful to operating system developers
who are writing SMP drivers, or just for users who want to test drive
an SMP machine to see what it looks like.</P
><P
>It is important to understand that configuring bochs for 4 processors will NOT make
your single-threaded applications run faster in general!  On the contrary, it
has to spend time simulating idle processors as well as the ones doing your
task.  The point is to simulate an SMP system, not to speed up a uniprocessor
application.</P

>What was required to make SMP work in Bochs?  (Note that only Linux 2.2
has been tested so far.)

Multiprocessor Configuration.  An SMP-aware operating system 
probes BIOS memory to find the structure, which contains information about
how many processors, their IDs, interrupt sources, etc.</P

are not implemented yet and cause a panic.  If you boot linux 2.4.3 for 
example, it says "panic: cluster model addressing not implemented".   See

>A number of people have suggested using threads to simulate each CPU in
a different thread.  Then on a real SMP machine, the threads can execute
in parallel.  This is a great idea, but it's not done at present.</P
