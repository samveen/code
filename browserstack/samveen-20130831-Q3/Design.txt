Components:
Webserver(on host)
proxy server(on device)

Host device communication:
* Requests coming to the device get redirected to the host to which the device is attached.
* Host web server uses ADB to connect to the device and launch commands as required using the activity manager command (am).

Example start command:
  am start -n -n browser.package/Main.View.Intent

Similarly intents can be sent for the other actions as well.


Components design:

Webserver options:
* Webserver hard coded with /start,/stop,/cleanup urls which handle appropriate actions
* Any general webserver with /start,/stop,/cleanup cgi scripts. 

Device proxy:
It just needs to be a really thin connection forwarder, something like an ssh tunnel, except the proxy can just forward the connection via TCP.
