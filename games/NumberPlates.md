## Introduction

Ida is very observant. In an effort to keep her busy, whenever we travel, I play
the "Vehicle Registration Number Plates" game with her. It involves looking at
the registration numbers of the vehicles and trying to find all states that we
can. 

Delhi is a the national capital, with a truly gigantic bureaucracy, with all the
government arms amply represented. This means that you can find vehicles from all
across the country here.

Since we started playing this game, Ida has started to recognise the number
plates from  almost all the states' and union territories of India. Much to my
dismay, with the lock-down due to the COVID-19 epidemic, along with travel,  our
learning playing has been disrupted

With that, I present to you an educational game for children with technically
savvy parents(technical skills required to run the game):
