## Requiem for the lost

This is a folder to remember the memoriable code that I wrote, those that I was really proud of
when I did them, but which unfortunately is now lost except for my memories of them, mainly due to
my inability for forsee the need for a good backup strategy. 

None the less, lessen learnt.
